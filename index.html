                        Arkane is known for implementing well thought out roleplaying elements within their games, with a leveling system not always based on XP but more so achievements. Players always feel like their characters are truly unlocking their potentials when playing their games, rather than being some sort of demigod with ultimate powers immediately.

                        One of the most important aspects of Arkane’s games is the atmosphere. The game world is always hand-crafted in a way rarely matched by any other, with locations drawing players into the scene as if they were there, characters who act and talk like real people. The consequences of the player’s actions are always felt in the world, with events playing out different depending on player choice.

                        While it might be easy to assume that with roleplaying and atmosphere being the centrepieces of their games Arkane might abandon combat and action sequences from them. This is highly untrue, as some of their games have the best combat and sneak systems in the industry. Melee and stealth synthesize with magic or other powers, and creates something truly unique and fun.
