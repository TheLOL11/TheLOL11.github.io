                    <aside>The first ever game considered to be an Immersive Sim was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_VI:_The_False_Prophet" target="_blank">'Ultima VI: The False Prophet'</a>.</aside>
                    <p class="articletext">Immersive sims are a genre of video games that emphasizes player choice, which is incorporated into a simulated world that responds to the actions of the player. Immersive sims in general can combine any genre of video games, but the most common ones merge Roleplaying elements with either a survival horror or action setting. Well known examples of immersive sims include Deus Ex, Bioshock and Dishonored.</p>
