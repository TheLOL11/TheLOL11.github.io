                <p class="gamesarticle">Arx Fatalis is an action-roleplaying immersive sim released in 2003. It was released as a spiritual successor to the Ultima Underworld series. Generally unknown to people who are not fans of Arkane or the game itself, it has a small but very devoted following. The game is set in a world where the sun vanishes, so the species of the world must migrate underground. While the game’s combat is a bit clunky, the atmosphere and storytelling of the game is exceptional. The best gameplay element is probably the magic system, where players must draw actual magical runes with their mouse in combinations to cast spells.</p>

                <p class="gamesarticle">Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is a role-playing game released in 2006. It is a part of the Might and Magic fantasy universe. The game follows apprentice Sareth, who is sent on a mission to retrieve an ancient artifact by his master Phenrig. The game’s writing is considered the “weakest” of all Arkane games, with its cliché story and bland characters. It is clear where Arkane put the most effort in with this game: The combat system. The combat in this game is phenomenal, with it utilizing Valve’s source engine to make the player use their environment smartly, with spells that accommodate for such combat.</p>

                <p class="gamesarticle">Prey is one of Arkane’s newer games, with it being released in 2017. It is a survival horror game set on a space station, which has been invaded by extra-dimensional aliens. The game combines elements of Arkane’s previous games, for example by implementing a kind-of magic system with the player being able to learn the powers of the aliens and utilizing them, or instead focusing solely on their human abilities. The writing is great, and you really feel like you’re hiding from an unknown force constantly, the atmosphere is on-point.</p>

                    <p class="dishonoredarticle">Dishonored is a stealth-action video game released in 2012. It is considered to be Arkane’s best game, as it is truly the culmination of all the best from their previous titles. Dishonored is set in a steampunk world, in the city of Dunwall, which is dying from a plague and its empress is murdered at the hands of an assassin, with this being blamed on the player character, and him ending up being "dishonored". The player has to accomplish different assassinations using powers granted to them by the universe’s chaotic "god", the Outsider, and avenging their fate either in force or with grace. The atmosphere is captivating, the combat is great, stealth is proper fun, and being an overpowered assassin is absolute joy. </p>
