                    <p>Arx Fatalis is set in a world, in which the sun has vanished from the sky, and humans and other races must now live underground. While living underground though, a new cult forms, which follows the god of destruction 'Akbaa', who is set on arriving on Arx and well, destroying everything. Arx Fatalis has not aged very well, but it’s unique story and systems make it quite enjoyable even today. The story goes that you wake up in a prison, unaware of how you got there, and must break out, using nothing but bones as your weapons. A fellow prisoner helps you escape, who calls you “Am Shaegar”, meaning “he who has no name” in a foreign tongue. You then go on to do many things to save the world from “Akbaa” and must defeat his minions. During the course of the game you learn runes, which you can use to cast spells. Once you know every rune needed to cast a spell, it appears in your spellbook, and you can cast it by pulling up your hand and drawing every single rune, but you can of course queue up spells for later. The game is set in an open world, that’s ironically not so open, being underground. The map is divided into 8 levels, each of which belong to a certain faction. These factions all have something to do related to the storyline and are very interesting to interact with (except the rat men, they just want to stab you and steal your money).</p>
